". . . all history is too small for even me;
for me and you,exceedingly too small."  -- e.e. cummings --

Facts, numbers, and names are not history.  

A collection of facts, numbers, and names is no more history than a map is the terrian it represents.  

History is storytelling.

It is a special kind ofstorytelling that is structured, inspired, and (to some degree) constrained by our understanding of data, reanimated by our own experiences and imaginations. 

"A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness." 
(From Science and Sanity by Alfred Korzybski - 1933)

We are constructing an index we can use to reference and relate the events and experiences that make up history.  

We are launching this project as a family project.  However, our family has always held a very open idea of what a 'family' is.  We see little distinction between 'family' and 'community'.  Yet, as subtle as it is, we see a powerful difference.  Family encompasses the rich interpersonal concern, compassion, acceptance, and intimacy that is not necessarily a part of all communities.

If you choose to contribute to this project, you are welcome to join this community of amateur historians.  

However, if you are open-hearted and kind, you are very likely to find yourself also welcome into our family.
